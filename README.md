basic calculator that can run addition, subtraction, division and multiplication as well as stringing operators. Going to use this calculator as a reflection of how far I have come. One thing that glancing at this I immediately notice is the use of single character names. The issue with this arises in that it isn't descriptive. Part of programming is reading and making sense and renaming my variables to be more descriptive would help immensely with that.
